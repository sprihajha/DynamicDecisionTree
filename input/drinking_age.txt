Why should the minimum drinking age remain at 21?
--If underage drinking leads to serious consequences, Can't 18-year-old legal adults make rational decisions regarding drinking?
----If No, The CDC reports that about 18 percent of high school students aged 16 and older reported drinking and driving. Even 18-year-olds often struggle to make rational decisions regarding drinking.
--If those who start drinking at a young age are more likely to get addicted, Don't you think keeping the drinking age at 21 would increase the desire to drink among those who are underaged?
----If No, Although some people may be more likely to drink because it's "forbidden fruit" the vast majority of Americans tend to follow the rules and thus would not risk drinking if it was illegal for them.
--If keeping the drinking age at 21 reduces the amount of alcohol consumption, Wouldn't reducing the drinking age improve the economy and tax revenue?
----If Yes, But we should not profit off of the harm of young adults aged 18-21.
