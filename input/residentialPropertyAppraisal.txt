If the number of properties found is 0, please answer "No". Otherwise, will you please respond "Yes"?

Include the other information in your appraisal report, but do not use it to calculate the value of the property directly.

--------------If No, Research upcoming developments that may affect the propery's value and restart the decision tree once finished. (e.g., a nearby gym being built may boost the property's value.)
------------If No, Research and document any zoning or usage rules affecting the property and revisit the decision tree once done. (e.g., if the house is in a heritage zone, the value of the property might be diminished due to limited extension options)
----------If No, Research and document local amenities, unique elements, and any environmental factors that could affect value. Then, refer back to the decision tree. (e.g., Proximity to a lake or special architectural facets may boost the property's value, so this information should be included in the appraisal report).
--------If No, Document the value of the land. The value can be calculated based on similar empty lots nearby. Resume the decision tree once done. (e.g., if comparable vacant lots are priced at $80 per square foot, and your property is 1000 square feet, your land is worth $80,0000. Consider using multiple other vacant lots and averaging the price per square foot to get a more accurate value)
------If No, Document the home's structure and essential systems. Then, come back to this decision tree. (e.g., check the basement for moisture issues, check the HVAC system, and review wiring. Any major issues must be included in the final appraisal report.)
----If No, Inspect the property throughly, document its results, then redo the decision tree.
--If No, First, obtain a legal description for the residential property. A legal description can usually be found in the most recent deed to the property. Consult local authorities or check legal documentation for the correct legal description. Once obtained, redo the decision tree.
